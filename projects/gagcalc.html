            <h1 class="txtcenter gagcalc-sechead">Features</h1>
            <p>This calculator allows for the calculation of damage dealt during a single round of battle using all damaging gag tracks and common SOS cards. On the main interface, the user is also able to toggle whether a cog is lured or not, and whether gags to add to a calculation are organic or not. To completely reset a calculation, users can simply press the "Reset damage" button. In addition to what is present on the main interface, the "Calculations" menu at the top of the program also features the following calculation modifiers:
                <ul>
                    <li>Cog Defense</li>
                    <li>Reinforced Plating (for levels 9-12)</li>
                    <li>Lock modifiers</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Under the "Program" menu, users can also find the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Settings</li>
                    <li>Pin Window to Top</li>
                    <li>Update Checker</li>
                    <li>Close Program</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>To help expedite certain functions, there are also several keybinds to use:
                <table class="gagcalc-table">
                    <tr><th>Key</th><th>Function</th></tr>
                    <tr><td>Shift</td><td>Toggle Organic</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Ctrl+L</td><td>Toggle Lured</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Ctrl+R</td><td>Reset Calculation</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Ctrl+D</td><td>Cycle through defense values</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Ctrl+V</td><td>Cycle through reinforced plating values</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Ctrl+X</td><td>Lock/Unlock modifiers</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Alt+Up</td><td>Pin/Unpin window</td></tr>
                </table>
            </p>
            <p>As new features continue to get added to Toontown Rewritten, I will continue to try to add on to and improve this gag calculator!</p>
